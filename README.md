The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the key protective elements in our brain. It separates the central nervous system (CNS) from the circulatory system and protects the brain against intrusive chemicals or foreign particles including some therapeutic agents. 

One of the most demanding areas in global pharmaceutical market is neuropharmaceuticals. The success rate of neuropharmaceuticals is very less compared to that of other therapeutic areas. 
One of the reasons for the relative low success rate is due to the BBB blocking the drugâ€™s entry into the brain, resulting in insufficient CNS exposure. Thus, most of the drugs fail to reach the market. The major challenge in the field of CNS pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is permeability criteria of BBB. Traditional experimental approaches to evaluate the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability of a drug are expensive and time consuming. 
Hence, several computational models have been developed over time to estimate propensities of compounds to penetrate the BBB
